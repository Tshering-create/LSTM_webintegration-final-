The interface is builds from a sequence prediction system that includes an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. People can input a series of numbers (separated by commas) and the LSTM model on the server uses that information to predict the next value. Clicking the “Predict” button gives us the model’s prediction 1.326255 in this case. Via this interface, deep learning models can be applied in practice, so users can easily use and interact with complex models on the web.
